Generate a single-page React application for a personal portfolio webpage with the following specifications:

- **Layout**: A single-page application with all content presented on the root route ("/").

- **Sections**:
  1. **Personal Statement Section**:
     - Include a header titled "About Me".
     - Below the header, place a paragraph element for the personal statement. Add placeholder text which I can replace with my own description of skills, experience, and professional interests.

  2. **Publications Section**:
     - Add a header titled "My Publications".
     - Under the header, create a list of placeholder titles for my papers. Each title should be a clickable link that will open the respective paper in a new tab. The links should have placeholders for URLs which I will fill in.

  3. **GitHub Projects Section**:
     - Include a header titled "Projects".
     - Display my GitHub projects in a grid or list. Each project should have:
       - A clickable title that links to the GitHub repository (use placeholder links).
       - A short placeholder description.
       - A placeholder for a thumbnail image of the project.
     - Ensure that each project link opens in a new tab when clicked.

- **Styling**:
  - Use a modern, clean, and professional-looking design with a coherent color scheme and typography.
  - Ensure the webpage is responsive, adapting smoothly to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop displays.

- **Functionality**:
  - Use modern React functional components with hooks for state management and lifecycle events where necessary.
  - Employ a structured and maintainable directory layout for components and assets.

- **Code Quality**:
  - Write clean, readable, and well-commented code.
  - Provide propTypes for all components and ensure the code follows best practices.

- **Documentation**:
  - Include a README file with instructions on how to run the application locally.
  - Add comments in the code to indicate where I can update the placeholders with my actual content.
